Create a visual simulation of what happened during the Tunguska event. Show the asteroid (presumed)
falling to Earth above a forest of evergreen trees. The asteroid explodes above the forest sending a
shockwave out. The trees are leveled when the shockwave hits them. Show an introductory title
screen. After the simulation completes show some statistics of the Tunguska event over the aftermath
and a prompt for 'q' to quit and 'space' to restart. Do not use any external resources like PNGs -
draw everything yourself.
