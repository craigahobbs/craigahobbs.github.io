**What to Bring:**

- Water Bottle
- Wear clothing that is comfortable to move and climb in. All climbing equipment is provided.

**What to Expect:**

The purpose of this activity is to introduce you to how we use Recreation Therapy to address the
cycle of anxiety in your childâ€™s life. While the activity itself provides much needed structure,
there is much more to this day than just rock climbing. We will experience and discuss what it means
to be in the Comfort, Growth and Panic zones, how important Exposure Response Prevention is for
anxiety, how experiences can build self-efficacy and reduce anxiety symptoms and how rock climbing
like many other activities can be a powerful tool for therapy. You do not need to have any
experience in climbing. All levels of skill are considered in this experience.
