# Craig and Maya's Wedding Ceremony


## Convocation

[Officiant, with humorous exaggeration: Mawage. Mawage is wot bwings us togeder tooday. Mawage, that
bwessed awangment, that dweam wifin a dweam... And wuv, tru wuv, will fowow you foweva!]

[Pause for laughter, then switch to normal voice:]

Craig & Maya, today we are gathered to witness your personal commitment to each other and to share
your great joy.

This ceremony is your chosen moment for the outward recognition of a sacred, inner union, which you
share with one another.

It is a time of rejoicing: for as two lives are joined together, families come together as well.
Through your marriage, your community, which offers its love and support, will expand and enrich
your lives. May you draw strength from them throughout the seasons of your lives.


## Invocation

The commitment of marriage is a decision, which is entered into with great consideration and
respect. The essence of this commitment is the acceptance of another person in their entirety, and
with this acceptance, then choosing them as a lifelong companion and a friend.

Marriage combines the strengths and will of two people so that they may learn and grow together, to
create a meaningful life where each can reach their dreams.

The paradox and the mystery of true love is to become one through unconditional surrender, while
maintaining your own uniqueness, and that of your partner. For these are the qualities of a
relationship which will endure the test of time and grow ever more deeply through the years to come.


## Personal Vows

*Groom reads vows*

*Bride reads vows*


## Expression of Intent


### Groom

Do you Craig, promise to love Maya, to live with her through this lifetime and to build with her a
home that is a place of love, joy, sharing and growing? (I Do)

Do you Craig promise to be with her in all her adversities and triumphs, to communicate with her
your most intimate thoughts and feelings and, above all, give her the freedom to be herself? (I Do)


### Bride

Do you Maya, promise to love Craig, to live with him through this lifetime and to build with him a
home that is a place of love, joy, sharing and growing? (I Do)

Do you Maya, promise to be with him in all of his adversities and triumphs, to communicate with him
your most intimate thoughts and feelings and, above all, give him the freedom to be himself? (I Do)

The Spirit of commitment, by which you exchange your vows, marks a bright, new beginning; in that
Spirit, may we celebrate the dawn of this marriage with fresh hopes, deepened understanding and a
quest for discovery.


## Blessing

> May your love continue to be the quiet certainty that lets you both be brave. May you keep
> choosing each other—not just on the easy days, but on the hard ones too. May your home be a place
> where stories are told, tears are met with comfort, and laughter is never rationed. May your love
> shine as brightly as holiday lights, illuminating every season of your lives together. And may you
> always remember that the greatest gift you give one another is simply this: showing up, staying,
> and loving anyway.


## Exchange of the Rings

The ring is a circle; a symbol of the eternal continuity of your love and devotion to one another.
By exchanging and wearing these rings, Craig and Maya are making a statement to the world and to
each other, that they have chosen to be together as one; united by love, for the rest of their
lives.

Repeat after me as you place the ring on your partner’s finger…

Maya, with this ring, I pledge my love to you.

Craig, with this ring, I pledge my love to you.


## Closing Wishes for the Couple

As we bring this ceremony to completion this afternoon, I would like to offer a moment for silence.
In this space, I invite you—their beloved children, parents, siblings, and family—to send Maya and
Craig your own personal thoughts, holiday wishes, and blessings as they enter a new relationship
with one another as husband and wife. And so, it is!


## Pronouncement of Marriage

Craig and Maya in the presence of us all, you have pledged your love for one another. We wish for
you a love that sustains you in all that you do. May your time together be one of growth, ever
learning from one another. May you be the sharers of each other’s joys, consolers in each other’s
sorrows, and always offering your best counsel.

May you plan together, dream together and build a life together which is far richer than any you
could have found alone. Through your marriage, may you discover true companionship and a most
generous share of happiness &amp; joy.

As you go your way today, may you always remember the words you have spoken and the love, which
brought you together!

It is now my great honor to pronounce you husband and wife!

You may kiss the bride!!
