# Cats!

## Morning

- Top-off each cats' food dishes. If the food in the dish looks old and chewed-up consider dumping
  it first.

  - The food and scoop are on the basement kitchen counter.

  - Extra food is under the basement kitchen sink.

- Scoop the litter box. Give the floor a vacuum if there's a lot of litter on it.

- Give Leo some outside time. About 5 minutes or so before you are ready to go, call him from the
  front door. If he doesn't come back, don't worry, you can let him in when you visit in the
  evening.

## Evening

- Top-off each cats' food dishes.

- Give Choco his pill. His pills are on the kitchen counter.

- One large can of ***wet food*** split three ways, equally.

- Give Leo some outside time. If he doesn't come back, he'll have an exciting night out!


## Other

- Play with those critters! Rough 'em and tell 'em what good kitties they are!

- Bring in the mail
