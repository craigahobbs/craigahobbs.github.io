# Cats!


## First Visit

- Dump food from day before

- Reset scale

- Give each cat 1 1/2 scoop, Leo’s 1/2 should be a little generous

- Top off water if getting low (dump and refill if nasty)

- Give Leo bathroom escort if needed

- Scoop litter boxes

- Let Leo out

  - You can let Leo out right when you get here or any time while you’re here


## Second Visit

If Leo is out, give him a call and shake some dry food so he can get on his way back while your
here. If Leo has not returned you can do the downstairs stuff first.

- Pill Chip

- Commence wet food ritual

- Top off dry food with 1- 1 1/2 scoops depending on what’s left

- Top off water if getting low (dump and refill if nasty)

- Give Leo bathroom escort if needed

- Check litter box to make sure it’s not overloaded - no one will use it if there are too many stinky poops


## Other

- Check mail

- Extra dry food is under downstairs sink
