# Cats!

Leo

- One large can in divider dish and two scoops of dry food in other side

- The button to open/close without changing settings is the first one on the right if youâ€™re
  facing the dish like the cat would. He might struggle a bit but eventually he will trigger it to
  open

- Refresh the brown toy/puzzle box with a few treats & fresh â€˜nip a couple times - does not need
  to be every day

- Itâ€™s up to you if you want to let him out around house or outside

- Please make sure to lock bedroom door when you leave (with Leo in it!)


All Cats, evening (or just when youâ€™re able to make it by, evening not important) wet food - ideally
together but ok to feed Leo upstairs

- One large can split three ways, equally

- Throw away leftover dry food after a full day and refill with fresh (basement, main, and
  upstairs levels - Leo should not get more than two scoops per day)

Leo outside time - only if convenient for you (Leoâ€™s favorite thing in lifeðŸ˜»)

----

All of the above are general guidelines, if you find other ways that work better, go for it. The
goal is to meet basic needs. I appreciate your help!

Also, please bring in the mail. Your dad might appreciate getting the trash out but he may also do
it before he leaves.

Thanks!
