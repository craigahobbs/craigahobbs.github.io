## Tesla Solar

The Tesla Solar system is comprised of:

- 36 solar panels that generate up to 11.34 kW
- 3 Powerwalls (home battery) that store up to 40.5 kWh
- SolarEdge inverter

Click here for the [system specification](solar.pdf).

For my family (2 adults, 2 teenagers, and an electric car), the system produced more (electric)
power than we needed most years.

During the day, the solar panels generate energy that is either used immediately, used to charge the
Powerwalls or is sent to the grid. When the sun goes down, the Powerwalls dispense power to the home
as needed. If the Powerwalls run out of power, it is drawn directly from the grid. Power that is
sent to the grid builds up a grid surplus, which you draw down when you draw power from the grid.

The system is a net energy producer (self-powered) from March through September. During the
remaining months, power is drawn from the grid surplus. In most years, we had excess surplus power
when the zero-out date of March 31st arrived. The only years the home wasn't fully powered were
those with system issues (see below).

You can see the system surplus here:

### Issues

- In 2021 or 2022, one of the Powerwalls failed. Tesla replaced it under warranty.

- In 2023, the SolarEdge inverter failed which stopped solar energy production. Tesla repaired it
  under warranty.

- In 2024, I had an issue with Pigeons roosting under the solar panels and their poop reduced energy
  production. I had the birds removed and had a blocking mesh installed around the solar panels to
  prevent future incursions.


## Hue Lights

The following rooms have Philips Hue lights:

- Family room
- Kitchen
- Dining room
- Living room
- Office
- Entry hallway
- All upstairs bedrooms
- Basement (with under-cabinet lights and above-cabinet orb)
- Upstairs hallway (with motion sensor)
- Basement hallway (with motion sensors)

You can turn the lights on, off, or dim them with the Hue light switches in each room. You can also
operate them using the Hue app. The traditional wall switches for each room need to be turned on to
power the Hue lights.

Because there are so many devices (lights, switches, sensors), the home requires two Hue hubs: one
for the main floor ("Main") and one for the upstairs and the basement ("Up/Down"). The hubs are
located in the main entry closet above the door.

Each hub has a schedule to turn on a set of lights around sunset and turn all lights off at
midnight.

**Note:** I've configured all the switches to match the entry hallway switch (which is a newer
variety). The "On" button is a toggle on-off, the "Off" button cycles through the default "scenes"),
and the dimmer buttons operate as expected. This behavior can be modified in the Hue app.

**Note:** We moved the floor lamps with Hue bulbs, and you'll want to remove them using the Hue app.
