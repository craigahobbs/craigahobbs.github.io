# Mines Launch Notes

## Immediate TODOs

- Send AP scores to Mines

- Trailhead proxy access for Mom and me


## Mechanical Engineering (ME) Tracks

I recommend taking a few hours to review the ME curriculum. After you do this, let's take some time
to discuss.

- Review the [ME undergraduate flow chart](images/me-flow.jpeg) and review all of the course
  descriptions:

  [Mines Courses](https://catalog.mines.edu/coursesaz/)

- Review the [ME tracks](images/me-tracks.jpeg) to see what piques your interest. Review the course
  descriptions of your chosen ME tracks.

I especially like the following ME tracks:

- Automation & Controls

- Energy


## Business and Entrepreneurship Minor

I like the [Business and Entrepreneurship minor](images/business.jpeg). Studying the economics and
business factors related to a career in engineering will help you understand the motivations that
form the organizations you'll be a part of after you graduate.

If you are interested in this minor, I recommend reading the course descriptions on the Business and
Entrepreneurship card.


## Career Center

I'm impressed with the Mines Career Center.

I'd recommend doing all the tasks on the **First Year** column of the [Career Center Services
card](images/career.jpeg) with special emphasis on the following (in order):

- Set up a 1:1 with a career advisor to discuss career exploration, interests, and internship
  planning. This is a relationship you'll keep throughout your time at Mines.

- Review the **Tools for Engineering Your Career** book they gave us at Launch. IMO this is well
  done.

- Work with your career advisor to write your college resume.

- Attend career day and the job fair to get a sense of what's out there and what employers care
  about.


## iPad for Note-Taking

During the student panel at Launch, one of the panel strongly recommended using an iPad with a
screen protector for note-taking. It has the following benefits:

- Taking notes by hand is better for retention

- Only one thing to bring to all classes for note-taking

- Easy to organize and search notes
